;;; Commentary:

;; `ert' tests for the pure half of agentpane.el: drawing a fixed list of
;; nodes into a buffer, with no helper process.  Run from the repository
;; root with
;;
;;     emacs --batch -L emacs -l ert -l agentpane -l agentpane-test \
;;       -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
;;
;; The nodes below are in the shape `jsonrpc.el' delivers -- plists with
;; keyword keys, arrays as vectors -- and their HTML is what `renderMarkdown'
;; emits for the markdown beside it.
